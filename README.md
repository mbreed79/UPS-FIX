I ordered this online and I thought it arrived broken. I was not about to use it on my computer until I investigated further.
I just got it from the mail and I can hear something broken and rattlinginside.
I got lucky and got the piece wedged in the vent. Looks like a piece of PCB<br/>

Getting this apart without breaking any tabs was a challenge<br/>
